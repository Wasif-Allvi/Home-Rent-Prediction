Welcome to Python-based Machine Learning project! In this repository, we delve into the world of predictive modeling, leveraging various techniques such as Data Exploration, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Linear Regression Model, and Random Forest Model.


##  Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to compare the performance of two popular regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, on a given dataset. By analyzing and showcasing their respective results, we aim to demonstrate how Random Forest outperforms Linear Regression in predictive accuracy.
## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a free-to-access website renowned for its extensive collection of diverse datasets. We acknowledge and express our gratitude to the data provider for making this dataset publicly available, enabling researchers and enthusiasts to explore and innovate in the field of Machine Learning.
## Features

- #### Data Exploration: 
    We begin by thoroughly exploring the dataset, gaining valuable insights into its structure, distribution, and patterns. Understanding the data is crucial for successful model building.

- #### Data Preprocessing
    Data preprocessing plays a pivotal role in enhancing the model's performance. We handle missing values and apply necessary transformations to ensure the data is suitable for modeling.

- #### Feature Engineering: 
    In this phase, we identify and create relevant features that contribute to the predictive power of our models. This step can significantly impact the model's overall performance.
- #### Linear Regression Model: 
    We implement the classic Linear Regression algorithm to establish a baseline for our predictive modeling. The R-squared value achieved by this model is approximately 0.65 means that approximately 65% of the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the linear relationship with the independent variables in the model.
- #### Random Forest Model: 
    Next, we introduce the powerful Random Forest model, which offers higher accuracy compared to Linear Regression. The Random Forest model yields an impressive R-squared value of around 0.96 means that the model correctly predicted around 96% of the cases in the test data.


## Importance of Data Preprocessing

One of the key takeaways from this project is the significance of data preprocessing in achieving superior model performance. Through proper handling of missing data and feature transformation, I witness a substantial boost in the Random Forest model's accuracy compared to Linear Regression.

I invite you to explore our code, datasets, and detailed documentation to gain valuable insights into the techniques employed and the outcomes observed.
